## ICEWS:
---

**Source Description:** Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) consists of events that represent interactions between the socio-political actors (for instance, cooperative or hostile actions between individuals, groups, sectors and nation states). Each event consists of a source actor, event type, target actor and the event timestamp. The repository has a dump of the events from 1995-2015. The events are automatically extracted from news articles by the BBN ACCENT event coder.

**Dataset Description:** The two datasets used in this work are subsets of the data present in the ICEWS repository as created by Garcia-Duran et al. (2018): 
1- ICEWS14: This is a short-range dataset consisting of the events that occurred in 2014.
2- ICEWS05-15: This is a long-range dataset consisting of the events that occurred between 2005 to 2015.

## GDELT
---

**Description:** GDELT (Global Data on Events, Location and Tone) project is a global initiative that consists of real-time data from print, broadcast and web news media from all around the world. Each event consists of 2 interacting actors, an action type and the event timestamp. GDELT consists of global events from 1979 till now and is updated every 15 minutes. For more information on the data source, kindly refer to this link (https://www.gdeltproject.org/).
